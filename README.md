# Todo.txt Touch

An experimental Android application by [Gina Trapani](http://ginatrapani.org) designed to manage your [todo.txt file](http://todotxt.com).

Goal is to get the app to read a todo.txt from [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) (and eventually other configurable cloud sources), sort and list tasks by context or project (like @phone, or @grocerystore) in tabs, mark items as done and move them to the done.txt file, and sync todo.txt and done.txt back to Dropbox in the background. 

Right now this is just an experimental, educational undertaking. There are already a multitude of decent task managers for Android, but it would be fun to do a little collaborative work and learn about Android development with a very basic app that does a very simple thing right now. 

Interested in joining in? Fork the project and talk to us on the [Todo.txt CLI mailing list](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/todotxt/).
